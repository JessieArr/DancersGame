# Optimal Weapon Builds

Below is a chart of the stats gained per level by each type of weapon:


| Weapon | Power | Skill | Defense | Magic | HP | Spirit | Charm | Totals Per Level |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Sword | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0.75 | 0.75 | 0.75 | 0.75 | 6 |
| 2H Sword | 1.25 | 1 | 0.75 | 0.75 | 0.75 | 0.5 | 0.75 | 5.75 |
| Knife | 0.75 | 1.25 | 0.75 | 0.75 | 0.5 | 1 | 1 | 6 |
| Axe | 1 | 0.75 | 1 | 0.75 | 0.75 | 1 | 0.5 | 5.75 |
| 2H Axe | 1.25 | 0.75 | 1.25 | 0.75 | 0.5 | 0.75 | 0.5 | 5.75 |
| Staff | 0.5 | 0.75 | 0.75 | 1.25 | 0.5 | 0.75 | 1.25 | 5.75 |
| Bow | 0.5 | 1.5 | 0.75 | 0.75 | 0.5 | 0.75 | 1 | 5.75 |
| Spear | 0.75 | 1.25 | 1 | 0.75 | 0.5 | 0.75 | 1 | 6 |
| Flail | 0.75 | 1.25 | 0.5 | 0.75 | 0.5 | 0.75 | 1 | 5.5 |
| Hammer | 1.5 | 0.75 | 0.5 | 0.75 | 0.75 | 0.75 | 0.75 | 5.75 |
| Glove | 1.25 | 0.75 | 0.75 | 0.5 | 1 | 0.75 | 0.75 | 5.75 |

With this in mind, here are some example builds and your final stats with each:

## Max HP

- Staff: 20 levels
- Glove: 78 levels

Final stats:

| Power | Skill | Defense | Magic | HP | Spirit | Charm | Lowest Stat |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| 99 | 78.5 | 78.5 | 69 | 93 | 78.5 | 88.5 | 69 |

Notes: this is the most balanced build that still reaches 93 HP - useful for playing as the second player in a multiplayer game since it gives you the highest HP regen while not counting your equipment's stat bonuses.

## Most Balanced Build

- Sword: 14 levels
- Axe: 14 levels
- Staff: 28 levels
- Glove: 42 levels

| Power | Skill | Defense | Magic | HP | Spirit | Charm | Lowest Stat |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| 99 | 82 | 85.5 | 82 | 82 | 82 | 89 | 82 |

Notes: extremely balanced build - probably optimal in terms of lowest stat. Only needs +17 stats on gear to max everything!
