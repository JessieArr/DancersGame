How to Breed in Scarlet/Violet . Breeding in Pokemon SV is done in the Picnic mechanic. Any time two Pokemon with compatible egg groups are in a picnic together, there is a random chance over time to generate an egg in the picnic basket at the end of your picnic table. Simply walk to it and press A to check for eggs. This can be a slow process, but can be done while AFK and requires no action from the player. It can also be sped up significantly using Sandwiches which grant Egg Power. Where to find Ditto . Ditto, which are able to breed with any breedable Pokemon, can be found in West Province Area Two and Three. They will disguise themselves as other Pokemon in the area, but can be revealed by using ZL to focus them which will show their name (or ???) if you haven’t encountered one before. Egg Power Sandwiches . Eggs can be used to increase the speed at which your pokemon lay eggs. You start the game with the Jam Sandwich recipe, but may eventually want to upgrade to the Great Peanut Butter sandwich later. Level 3 requires herba mystica and isn’t really much of an improvement: . | Egg Power 1: Jam Sandwich - Strawberry, Jam | Egg Power 2: Great Peanut Butter - Banana, Peanut Butter, Butter | .

EV Removal . If you’ve trained EVs you don’t want, use these berries to get rid of them. Note that the first berry immediately reduces EVs to 100 if they are above 100, so you need a maximum of 11 to fully reset a stat: . | Item | Where to Get | What it Does | . | Kelpsy | Tera Raids/Sparkling Pickups in East Province Area 2 | Decreases Attack EVs by 10 | . | Hondew | Tera Raids/Sparkling Pickups in East Province Area 2 | Decreases Special Attack EVs by 10 | . | Qualot | Tera Raids/Sparkling Pickups in East Province Area 1 | Decreases Defense EVs by 10 | . | Grepa | Tera Raids/Sparkling Pickups in East Province Area 1 | Decreases Special Defense EVs by 10 | . | Pomeg | Tera Raids/Sparkling Pickups in East Province Area 2 | Decreases HP EVs by 10 | . | Tamato | Tera Raids/Sparkling Pickups in East Province Area 1 | Decreases Speed EVs by 10 | .
