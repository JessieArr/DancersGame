# Welcome

Welcome to Dancer's Game - a website of various notes and articles I've written about games I played. I generally aim to structure such articles as information-dense quick reference tools that can quickly get you up to speed on all relevant details about a certain aspect of a game. If you enjoy this type of content, then you're in the right place!!
